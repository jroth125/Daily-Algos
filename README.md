# Daily-Algos
A repo to track my daily algo practice and solutions to them!

### I've decided to track my daily algo practice as I study for interviews and hone my computer science / data structure skills

"*Why*?", you may ask?

*Because* posting algos to gihutb will help me stay motivated, keep my work transparent, and hold me
accountable to you all, the GitHub world!

So, enjoy, and let me know if you have any suggestions, comments, feedback, etc.
